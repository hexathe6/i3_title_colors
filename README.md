![Logo](docs/logo-30.png) i3: A tiling window manager
=====================================================

i3 is a tiling window manager for X11.

This is @hexa6's fork.

The fork currently only contains a version of @airblader's patch to 4.22. I (hexa6) will add more features when I get time to implement them.

Current features, releative to mainline i3:
- per-window title colors with `for_window` and `client.[focused | focused_inactive | unfocused | urgent]`

Planned features:
- thin, textless titlebar
